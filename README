I guess I am supposed to add a read me because that's what developers do. 

This was my first project so I don't really know what git does, but I always hear about it on YouTube so I figured I'd upload the projects I make from my roadmap (https://roadmap.sh/python) here

I think I made the code pretty simple in the sense you can easily add a new multiple choice question (of course with A,B,C, or D formatting), so if you just want to create a simple quizz for your friends I think this
would be pretty easy to work with.

All feedback is appreciated (atleast I think you're able to give feedback on git, idk tho)
